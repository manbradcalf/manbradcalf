My name IRL name is Ben Medcalf. I'm a self-taught engineer who loves making life easier via code.

I spend my days building CI/CD pipelines and end to end tests for mobile apps📱 at CarMax 🚘

When I'm not doing that, I'm always building _something_ to make life a little easier, such as...

#### 🚧 Under Construction 
- 🏈 [Neo4j graph database of NFL player stats](https://github.com/manbradcalf/nfl-player-stats-node) scraped from ESPN so I can pwn my fantasy drafts with elite querying
