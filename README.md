### I'm Ben Medcalf, a self-taught engineer who loves making life easier via code.

I spend my days building CI/CD pipelines and end to end tests for mobile apps at CarMax in beautiful Richmond, Virginia.
When I'm not doing that, I'm always building _something_ to make life a little easier, for example.
