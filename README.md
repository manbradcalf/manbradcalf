### Hello there, nice to meet you!

I'm Ben Medcalf, a self-taught engineer who loves making life easier via code.

I spend my days building CI/CD pipelines and end to end tests for mobile apps at CarMax in beautiful Richmond, Virginia.
When I'm not doing that, I'm always building _something_ to make life a little easier. 

Here are some examples of things I've been working on lately

#### 📲 In the [store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bookyrself.bookyrself&hl=en_US)
- 🎸[Native Android application for DIY artists](https://github.com/manbradcalf/Artie-Android) to simplify the painful process of booking events. Named after [Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0s2Tk-cbig)

#### 🚧 Under Construction 
- 🏈 [Neo4j graph database of NFL player stats](https://github.com/manbradcalf/nfl-player-stats-node) scraped from ESPN so I can pwn my fantasy drafts with elite querying
- 🎸[React Native version of the Artie app](https://github.com/manbradcalf/Artie-React-Native) because I eventually realized DIY artists have iPhones
- 🎸[API for the Artie app](https://github.com/manbradcalf/Artie-Express)
- 🧙‍♂️ A Flask webapp that acts as a ["Mood Board" for the DnD campaign I DM for](https://github.com/manbradcalf/DND-Mood-Board) 

I'm always eager to collaborate on stuff that piques my interest so please reach out! If you think about any of this stuff all the time like I do, we'll be fast friends.
